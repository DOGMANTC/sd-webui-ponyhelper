Extension for A1111, generate prompt randomly.

You can add your category easily. Just add a .csv file in the csv folder. The script will automatically add it to the interface.
Each entry must be on a different line in the .csv file. Do not use special characters, no commas, only - are accepted.
The file name must have a specific format, e.g. x_xnameoffile.csv.
The x are numbers which will determine the display order in the prompt (alphabetical order).
